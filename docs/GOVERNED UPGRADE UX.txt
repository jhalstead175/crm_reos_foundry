GOVERNED UPGRADE UX

Capability-Based, Timeline-Safe, Non-Intrusive

1️⃣ UPGRADE UX PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

🚫 No blocking workflows

🚫 No surprise limits

🚫 No feature lockouts mid-action

🚫 No pricing banners everywhere

✔ Upgrade only when value is experienced

✔ Upgrade always explains why

✔ Upgrade is reversible

Rule of thumb:

If a user notices pricing before value, the UX failed.

Empty states

Soft limits notices

Rules

No feature matrices longer than one screen

Capabilities described in plain language

No “recommended” badge

No countdowns

No urgency copy

Structure

Your Current Capability

→ What You Could Do Next
→ Upgrade / Downgrade

6️⃣ TRIAL UX (HIGH-CONVERSION, GOVERNED)
Trial Rules

One-click trial

No credit card change mid-trial

Clear start + end dates

Automatic downgrade (with warning)

Trial Copy

“Try Growth for 14 days.
You’ll return to Foundation automatically unless you choose otherwise.”

This builds trust.

7️⃣ DOWNGRADE UX (OFTEN IGNORED — CRITICAL)
Rules

Downgrade always available

No punishment

No data loss

No scary warnings

Copy

“You’ll keep all your data.
Some advanced capabilities will stop running.”

🔒 Events remain immutable
🔒 Timeline remains intact

8️⃣ GOVERNANCE ENFORCEMENT CHECKLIST

Before shipping any upgrade-related UI:

☐ No new screen added

☐ No primary workflow blocked

☐ Copy explains value, not price

☐ No plan-based UI forks

☐ AI UX Review approved

Failure = rejection.

9️⃣ WHY THIS UX WORKS (STRATEGICALLY)

Converts after value is felt

Reduces churn from resentment

Encourages organic upgrades

Scales with roadmap

Keeps buyers/sellers invisible to pricing

This is anti-CRM pricing UX — and that’s why it wins.

🏁 FINAL SUMMARY

This upgrade UX:

Feels human

Respects professionals

Preserves governance

Maximizes LTV without manipulation

Is extremely hard for competitors to copy

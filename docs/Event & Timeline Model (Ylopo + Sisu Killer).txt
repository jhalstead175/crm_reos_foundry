Event & Timeline Model (Ylopo + Sisu Killer)

Unified Event + Timeline Model: "Transaction Chronos"
Core Philosophy
A real estate transaction is a chronological sequence of events, not a collection of separate systems. Every action, communication, milestone, and task shares the same temporal DNA.

1. Event Types (Hierarchical Taxonomy)
Level 1: Category (The "What")
Communication: Any information exchange between parties
Action: Physical or digital activity performed
Milestone: Pre-defined significant points in transaction lifecycle
System: Automated events generated by the platform
Decision: Points where choices are made that alter transaction path

Level 2: Subtypes (The "How")
Communication Events
email (inbound/outbound)

sms/text

phone_call (logged, not recorded)

in_person_meeting

document_shared

notification_sent

Action Events
property_showing

document_signed

inspection_performed

repair_completed

payment_made

document_uploaded

Milestone Events
lead_qualified

listing_activated

offer_submitted

offer_accepted (mutual acceptance)

contingency_released (inspection, financing, appraisal)

clear_to_close_received

closing_completed

possession_transferred

System Events
deadline_created

reminder_sent

status_changed

document_generated

integration_sync

Decision Events
price_adjusted

repair_negotiated

contingency_waved

extension_granted

cancellation_initiated

Level 3: Context (The "Why")
Each event includes a context field that ties it to a transaction phase:

lead_nurturing

property_preparation

offer_negotiation

due_diligence

closing_preparation

post_close

2. Ownership Rules
Primary Owner Assignment
Actor Principle: Who performed the action owns the event

Recorder Fallback: If system-generated, owner is the user who triggered it

System Default: Automated events owned by the platform bot "Chronos"

Multi-Party Events
For events involving multiple roles (e.g., property showing):

Primary Owner: Role who initiated/coordinated (usually Realtor)

Co-Owners: Other participating roles (Buyer, Showing Agent)

All owners can add notes but cannot edit core event data

Ownership Transfer Rules
Never transferred automatically (preserves audit trail)

Manual transfer only by system admins with justification log

Inheritance: When a role leaves transaction, ownership passes to their supervisor or designated replacement

3. Visibility Rules by Role
Core Principle: "Temporal Need-to-Know"
Visibility determined by:

Temporal relevance (events within role's active phase)

Direct involvement (role was participant or subject)

Dependency (events that trigger role's responsibilities)

Role-Specific Filters
Realtor:

Full visibility of all events in their transactions

Filtered view of other agents' transactions (MLS-public events only)

Never see: Other agents' commission details, personal client notes from other agents

Buyer/Seller:

All events they participate in directly

System events that affect their deadlines or responsibilities

Milestone events for entire transaction

Never see: Internal agent communications, other party's financial details, attorney privileged communications

Closing Attorney:

Contract-related events from mutual acceptance forward

Document events (signatures, uploads, generations)

Financial events affecting closing statements

Never see: Early negotiation details, showing feedback, personal communications not relevant to title

Mortgage Broker:

Financial qualification events

Document collection events

Appraisal and underwriting events

Never see: Repair negotiations, personal communications between buyer/seller

Insurance Provider:

Property detail events (address, features, values)

Closing date events

Never see: Financial terms, personal information beyond required for quoting

Subcontractor:

Work order assignment events

Property access events

Payment-related events for their work

Never see: Transaction financials, personal client information, communications not about their scope

Temporal Window Rules
Past: Events older than 30 days collapse into summary view

Future: Upcoming events visible based on role's preparation window (3 days for subcontractors, 14 days for attorneys)

Present: Current day events highlight based on priority

4. Automation Triggers
Trigger Types
1. Temporal Triggers (Schedule-based)
text
WHEN [milestone_reached] + [days_offset]
THEN [create_event] + [notify_roles]
Example:
WHEN offer_accepted + 1 day
THEN create_event: inspection_deadline + notify: buyer_agent, buyer, inspector

2. Sequential Triggers (Event-based)
text
WHEN [event_type] [status]  
AND [prerequisite_event] [status]  
THEN [next_event_auto_create]
Example:
WHEN inspection_completed status:failed
AND repair_request NOT EXISTS
THEN create_event: repair_negotiation_window

3. Conditional Triggers (Data-based)
text
WHEN [field] [condition] [value]  
THEN [create_event] + [adjust_timeline]
Example:
WHEN loan_type = "FHA"
AND property_age > 40
THEN create_event: FHA_repair_requirement_check

4. Escalation Triggers (Timeout-based)
text
WHEN [event] [status] = pending  
AND [current_time] > [due_date] + [grace_period]  
THEN [escalate_to] + [create_alert_event]
Example:
WHEN appraisal_scheduled status:pending
AND current_time > due_date + 2 days
THEN escalate_to: mortgage_broker_supervisor + create_alert: appraisal_delay_risk

Automation Hierarchy
Level 1: Notifications only (no event creation)

Level 2: Event creation with human approval

Level 3: Full automation with audit trail

Level 4: Conditional timeline adjustment (requires supervisor review)

5. Timeline Compression Rules (Noise Reduction)
Compression Layers
Layer 1: Micro-Compression (Within 1 hour)
Rule: Events of same type from same owner within 60 minutes collapse
Example: Multiple document uploads become "3 documents uploaded"
Exception: Financial documents never compress (audit requirement)

Layer 2: Daily Compression (Within role view)
Rule: Routine communications collapse into daily summary
Example: "5 emails exchanged with buyer" instead of each email
Toggle: Users can expand to see individual events
Exception: Communications containing decisions or deadlines remain expanded

Layer 3: Phase Compression (Past completed phases)
Rule: Completed transaction phases show only milestones
Example: "Due diligence phase: 14 events over 10 days"
Expandable: Click to see full phase timeline
Auto-expand: Current phase always fully expanded

Layer 4: Role Compression (Irrelevant events)
Rule: Events not matching role's visibility rules auto-hide
Example: Subcontractor doesn't see mortgage approval events
Override: "Show all events" toggle available for supervisors

Smart Summarization Rules
Communication Bundles
text
IF events: [email_sent, email_received, phone_call]  
AND timeframe: < 4 hours  
AND participants: same  
THEN bundle_as: "Conversation with [participant]"  
WITH summary: "[count] exchanges about [topic extracted from subjects]"
Status Update Chains
text
IF events: [status_changed, status_changed, status_changed]  
AND timeframe: < 24 hours  
THEN bundle_as: "Status evolution: [initial] → [final]"  
WITH details: Show only initial and final states
Batch Actions
text
IF events: [document_signed × N]  
AND timeframe: < 1 hour  
AND context: same (e.g., closing docs)  
THEN bundle_as: "Batch signing completed"  
WITH count: N documents
Noise Score Algorithm
Each event receives noise score based on:

Redundancy: Similar to recent events? (+20 points)

Low Impact: Does not change status or deadline? (+10 points)

Internal Only: System-to-system? (+15 points)

High Frequency: Many from same source? (+5 per event over 3/day)

Compression Thresholds:

Score 0-19: Always show

Score 20-49: Collapse after 24 hours

Score 50+: Collapse after 1 hour

User Control Over Compression
Personal threshold adjustment: Users can set compression sensitivity

Pin important events: Pinned events never compress

Expand all/compress all: One-click control per transaction

Role-based defaults: Different compression profiles per role type

Model Implementation Principles
1. Immutable Event Core
Once created, event's type, timestamp, owner, and participants cannot change. Notes and metadata can be appended.

2. Temporal Integrity
All events exist on a single timeline. No parallel or disconnected event streams.

3. Role-Adaptive Presentation
Same underlying data, dynamically presented based on viewer's role and current context.

4. Progressive Disclosure
Timeline shows compressed view by default, expands based on user interaction and relevance.

5. Automated Narrative Generation
System can generate plain-English summaries of timeline segments for client reporting.

Model Promise: One timeline to rule them all, adapting to each viewer's needs while maintaining a single source of temporal truth. Complexity reduced through intelligent compression, not elimination.

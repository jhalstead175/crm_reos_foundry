Object Model (CRM Entities)

Global Navigation Architecture: "Progressive Disclosure Navigation"
Core Principle
"Show users only what they need, when they need it. Navigation should adapt to role, context, and transaction phase."

1. Top-Level Navigation (Persistent Across All Screens)
Primary Zone (Left Rail - Always Visible)
text
[Dashboard] → Role-specific landing view
[Search] → Universal object search (people, properties, transactions)
[Notifications] → Timeline of relevant updates
[Help] → Contextual help + quick tutorials
Context Zone (Center - Adapts to Current Work)
Dynamically changes based on active object or task:

When viewing a Transaction: [Timeline] [Documents] [Tasks] [Contacts]

When viewing a Property: [Details] [Gallery] [Comparables] [History]

When viewing a Person: [Profile] [Activity] [Documents] [Notes]

Action Zone (Top Right - User-Specific)
text
[Quick Create] → Context-aware creation menu
[User Menu] → Profile, settings, role switching
[View Toggle] → Density, layout, focus mode
2. Contextual Navigation Rules
Rule 1: Object-First Navigation
text
Click object (person, property, transaction) → Reveals object-specific navigation
Leave object context → Returns to primary navigation
Rule 2: Phase-Based Menu Items
Transaction menu items appear/disappear based on phase:

Pre-offer: [Comparables] [Market Analysis] [Showing Schedule]

Active: [Timeline] [Contingencies] [Documents] [Communications]

Closing: [Settlement] [Funding] [Recording]

Post-Close: [Follow-up] [Referral] [Archive]

Rule 3: Role-Prioritized Actions
Each role sees 3-5 most frequent actions first:

Realtor: [New Listing] [Schedule Showing] [Generate Offer]

Buyer: [Save Property] [Ask Question] [Upload Document]

Attorney: [Review Contract] [Update Status] [Request Signature]

Rule 4: Progressive Disclosure
Less frequent actions live behind "More" menus:

Primary actions: Always visible

Secondary actions: Visible in context

Tertiary actions: Behind "⋯" menu

3. Feature Appearance/Disappearance by Role

4. Anti-Patterns to Avoid
Navigation Anti-Patterns
Never: Hamburger menus on desktop (hidden navigation)

Never: More than 7 top-level items at once

Never: Nested flyout menus more than 2 levels deep

Never: Context switching without clear breadcrumbs

Never: Modal navigation (losing context)

Feature Visibility Anti-Patterns
Never: Show all features to all users ("toolbar soup")

Never: Hide frequently used features

Never: Change navigation location mid-task

Never: Auto-hide critical navigation during input

Never: Require more than 3 clicks to frequent destinations

Role Management Anti-Patterns
Never: Show users features they can't access

Never: Require role switching for basic tasks

Never: Create "admin" views that are just all features enabled

Never: Hard-code role permissions in UI instead of data layer

Why This Structure Prevents CRM Bloat
1. Feature Hiding by Design
80% of users use 20% of features daily → Show only that 20% prominently

Advanced features exist but don't clutter primary navigation

New features enter via "Labs" section before promotion to main nav

2. Role-Based Feature Allocation
Mortgage tools don't burden Realtors

Marketing tools don't confuse Buyers

Each role sees a "purpose-built" CRM for their job

3. Contextual Revelation
Document templates appear when creating documents

CMA tools appear when viewing properties

Closing calculators appear near closing dates

Features appear when needed, disappear when not

4. Progressive Complexity
New users see basic navigation (3-4 main items)

As they learn, more features become available

Power users can enable "advanced mode" for everything

No one is overwhelmed on day one

5. Metrics-Driven Pruning
Navigation items track usage frequency

Features used by <5% of role after 90 days get demoted to "More"

Unused features (>6 months) get archived or removed

Navigation evolves based on actual use, not feature checklist

6. Unified Search as Safety Net
If users can't find something in navigation, they can search

Search results educate about feature location

Navigation can stay lean because search handles edge cases

7. Task-Based Over Function-Based
"Schedule a showing" not "Calendar module"

"Create an offer" not "Documents module"

"Update closing status" not "Transaction admin"

Users think in tasks, navigation should match

Architecture Promise: "This CRM will never become a cluttered toolbar of every possible feature. Instead, it will feel like a custom-built tool for your specific role and current task, revealing depth only as you're ready for it."

Core Object Principles
Transaction-Centric: Everything relates back to a transaction

Person-Focused: People are first-class entities, not just contact info

Immutable History: Critical objects never delete, only archive

Role-Filtered Views: Same objects, different visibility per role

Lifecycle Aware: Objects understand their stage and behave accordingly

Relationship-Rich: Objects know their connections to other objects

Model Promise: "This isn't a database of separate tables; it's a living graph of relationships that mirrors how real estate actually works. Every object knows its context, its relationships, and its purpose in moving transactions forward."

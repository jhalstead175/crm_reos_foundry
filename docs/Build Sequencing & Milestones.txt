Success Metrics Framework
Business Metrics (Track Weekly)
Activation: % of users who create first transaction

Target: > 60% in first 24 hours

Engagement: Weekly active users / Monthly active users

Target: > 50% (users coming back weekly)

Retention: % of users still active after 30 days

Target: > 40% (real estate is periodic)

Transaction Coverage: % of user's real transactions in system

Target: > 70% (measured via manual check-ins)

Product Metrics (Track Daily)
Task Success Rate: % of attempted tasks completed without error

Target: > 90%

Time to Task: Minutes to complete key tasks (add transaction, upload doc, send update)

Target: < 3 minutes per core task

Error Rate: % of interactions resulting in errors

Target: < 2%

Performance: Page load time (Time to Interactive)

Target: < 3 seconds on 3G

Technical Metrics (Monitor Continuously)
Uptime: System availability

Target: > 99.5%

API Response Time: P95 latency

Target: < 500ms

Incidents: Unplanned downtime or severe bugs

Target: < 1 per week post-launch

Learning Metrics (Review Monthly)
User Feedback: Feature requests per user

Healthy: 1-2 per user (engaged but not frustrated)

Support Load: Tickets per active user

Target: < 0.1 (1 ticket per 10 users per week)

Qualitative Insights: "Aha moments" observed in user testing

Target: At least 1 new insight per month

Risk Mitigation Plan
High Risks & Mitigations:
Risk: Agents don't see value beyond spreadsheet

Mitigation: Beta focuses on transaction coordination pain points

Signal: Beta users voluntarily invite other transaction participants

Risk: Complex transactions break simple model

Mitigation: Start with residential sales only (no commercial, rentals)

Signal: Beta transactions complete without workarounds

Risk: Team builds wrong features

Mitigation: Weekly user testing, even with paper prototypes

Signal: Feature usage > 50% of users in first week

Risk: Technical debt slows iteration

Mitigation: 20% of each sprint dedicated to tech debt

Signal: New feature delivery time stays consistent

Pivot Criteria:
If after 8 weeks of production:

Activation rate < 30%

Retention rate < 20%

No organic growth (invites/referrals)

Then reconsider:

Target user (maybe team coordinators, not agents)

Core value prop (maybe document management, not timeline)

Business model (maybe freemium, not subscription)

Resource Allocation
Team Focus Over Time:
Weeks 1-8: All hands on core product

Weeks 9-12: 80% product, 20% beta preparation

Weeks 13-16: 60% product, 40% beta support

Weeks 17+: 70% iteration, 30% growth/marketing

Budget Allocation:
Months 1-2: Infrastructure only (~$500/month)

Months 3-4: Infrastructure + tooling (~$1000/month)

Post-launch: Scale with users (~$10/user/month target)

Build Philosophy: "Build the simplest thing that could possibly work, test it with real users, then make it slightly less simple based on what we learn."

Key Insight: The 4-month timeline is aggressive but possible because:

We're solving a narrow problem (transaction coordination)

We're using boring technology (fast development)

We're validating continuously (not building in a vacuum)

We're starting with governance (prevents rework)

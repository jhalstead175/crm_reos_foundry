CRM UI/UX Governance Framework

UI/UX Governance Framework
Document: GOV-UI-001
Version: 2.0
Effective Date: Upon Publication
Applicability: All product teams, designers, and engineers contributing to the SaaS CRM interface

1. Authority & Introduction of New UI Patterns
1.1 Design Authority Board (DAB)
Composition: Principal Designer (Chair), Head of Product, Lead Frontend Architect, Accessibility Specialist

Term: Rotating 6-month terms, except Chair (12 months)

Quorum: 3 of 4 members required for binding decisions

1.2 Who May Propose New Patterns
Level 1 (Minor Adjustments): Any designer or senior engineer may propose variations to existing patterns via the Component Library PR process

Level 2 (New Components): Only Product Designers (P2+) or Technical Leads may propose new components

Level 3 (New Interaction Patterns): Requires sponsorship from a DAB member and formal proposal (Template: GOV-PROP-UI-001)

1.3 Introduction Process
Proposal Submission → DAB Review (5 business days) → Experimental Implementation → A/B Test (2 weeks minimum) → Analytics Review → General Release

2. Review Criteria for New Screens
All new screens must pass the 5-Gate Review before engineering implementation:

Gate 1: Strategic Alignment
Solves a documented user pain point (reference: user story/feedback ticket)

Aligns with quarterly product roadmap objectives

Does not duplicate existing functionality (>70% overlap prohibited)

Gate 2: Usability & Accessibility
Passes WCAG 2.1 AA automated scan

Keyboard navigation flow documented

Screen reader narrative provided

Touch targets ≥ 44px on mobile

Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (text)

Gate 3: Technical Consistency
Uses existing components from vetted library (≥80% reuse)

Documents exceptions with justification

Follows API patterns from existing screens

Performance budget: < 3s initial load, < 100ms interaction response

Gate 4: Data & Privacy
Only displays data according to role-based permissions

No PII displayed without masking unless explicitly required

Export/print functionality respects data boundaries

Audit trail generated for sensitive actions

Gate 5: Business Logic Validation
Mirror review by subject matter expert (e.g., realtor for transaction flows)

Legal/compliance sign-off for regulated interactions

Error states for all possible failure modes

Success criteria defined (metrics to track)

3. Quarterly UX Drift Prevention Checklist
Conducted by DAB + 2 rotating team members from different squads

Visual Consistency Audit
Spacing tokens used consistently (±1px tolerance)

Color palette deviations < 5% of screens

Typography hierarchy followed in ≥ 95% of instances

Iconography from approved set only

Interaction Parity Check
Similar actions trigger similar responses across modules

Loading states follow defined patterns (skeleton vs spinner)

Error handling consistent in tone and recovery paths

Confirmation dialogs used only for destructive actions

Navigation Integrity
Breadcrumb depth ≤ 4 levels

No dead-end screens without "next action"

Back button behavior consistent (history vs parent)

Mobile navigation collapses predictably

Accessibility Compliance Spot Check
10% of screens tested with screen reader

5% of forms tested keyboard-only

Focus management verified on modal/drawer open

Alternative text exists for all informative images

4. Versioning Rules for UI Changes
4.1 Semantic Versioning for UI Library
text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-PREVIEW
MAJOR: Breaking changes to API, removal of components, visual rebrands

MINOR: New components, non-breaking enhancements

PATCH: Bug fixes, accessibility improvements, minor tweaks

PREVIEW: Experimental features (enabled via feature flag)

4.2 Change Classification & Notification
Change Type	Version Bump	User Notice Required	Migration Path
Component API change	MAJOR	30 days before deprecation	Codemod provided
Visual style change	MINOR	In-app changelog	Automatic
New component	MINOR	Documentation only	N/A
Bug fix	PATCH	None	Automatic
Accessibility fix	PATCH	Optional	Automatic
4.3 Rollout Windows
Patch releases: Weekly (Tuesday)

Minor releases: Bi-weekly (1st & 3rd Thursday)

Major releases: Quarterly, aligned with product planning cycles

No UI releases on Friday

5. Safe UI Deprecation Protocol
Phase 1: Announcement (Day 0)
Mark component as deprecated in Storybook/FigJam

Add console warning in development mode

Update documentation with migration guide

Notify all teams via #ui-deprecations channel

Phase 2: Dual Support (Days 1-60)
Both old and new versions available

Feature flag controls new version (off by default)

Usage analytics track migration progress

Weekly automated emails to teams using deprecated component

Phase 3: Soft Enforcement (Days 61-90)
Deprecated component shows visual degradation (opacity 0.9)

Console warnings become errors in CI pipeline

New PRs using deprecated component require override approval

Dashboard shows migration progress by team

Phase 4: Hard Removal (Day 91+)
Component removed from main export

Legacy version available via /legacy import (6 months only)

Automated migration script runs on all repositories

Final cleanup in next MAJOR release

Exception: If >15% of critical user journeys still use deprecated component at Day 75, extend timeline by 30 days.

6. Rule: No New UI Without Reuse
6.1 The 80/20 Reuse Rule
All new interfaces must consist of:

≥80% existing vetted components

≤20% new/custom elements (requires DAB exception)

6.2 Requesting Exception to 80/20 Rule
Submit Reuse Exception Request (Template: GOV-EXCEPT-UI-001) with:

Inventory: List of all UI elements in proposed screen, categorized as Existing/New

Justification: Why existing components cannot be used (with evidence)

Future Potential: How new component will be reused in next 2 quarters

Maintenance Plan: Who owns component documentation, testing, updates

6.3 Reuse Registry
All new components approved under exception enter Reuse Registry with:

Primary Owner: Team that introduced it

Reuse Quota: Minimum 3 implementations within 90 days

Sunset Clause: If quota not met, component deprecated automatically

Reuse Score: Tracked in component library dashboard (visible to all teams)

6.4 Incentive Structure
Teams meeting ≥95% reuse receive "UI Efficiency" recognition

Components exceeding reuse quota (used by ≥5 teams) enter "Hall of Fame"

Reuse metrics included in quarterly engineering reviews

Compliance & Enforcement
Monitoring
Automated scanning of PRs for component usage

Weekly DAB review of exception requests

Monthly compliance report to Head of Engineering

Violations
Minor: PR blocked until brought into compliance

Major: Team requires DAB review of next 3 UI changes

Severe: UI commit privileges suspended pending retraining

Appeals Process
Written appeal to DAB within 5 business days

Review with additional rotating member from different team

Decision within 3 business days, documented in governance log

Governance Principle: "We value consistent, accessible experiences over novelty. Every new interface element must justify its existence through measurable user benefit and future reuse potential."

FIGMA COMPONENT CONTRACT

Real Estate Multi-Party CRM (Non-Visual)

SECTION 1 — PURPOSE & AUTHORITY

1.1 Purpose
This contract defines the allowed structure of all Figma components used in the CRM.
Its goal is to:

Enforce UI reuse

Maintain cognitive consistency across roles and workflows

1.2 Authority
No component may be introduced, modified, or extended unless it complies with this contract.

SECTION 2 — COMPONENT HIERARCHY (MANDATORY)

All Figma components MUST belong to exactly one of the following layers:

L1 — Primitives

Text

Icon

Spacing

Divider

Status indicator

Never context-aware

No business logic

No role variance

L2 — Elements

Examples:

Button

Input

Toggle

Badge

🔒 Rules:

Stateless or minimally stateful

Variants allowed ONLY via tokens

No layout responsibility

L3 — Blocks

Examples:

Card

List Row

Timeline Event

Property Summary

Person Summary

🔒 Rules:

May compose L1 + L2 only

Single responsibility

L4 — Sections

Examples:

Activity Timeline

Task Panel

Document Panel

Transaction Summary

Property Overview

🔒 Rules:

No new visual primitives

Must be assembled entirely from L3 + L4

No component logic inside screens

❌ Fail Condition
Any component that spans multiple layers.

SECTION 3 — NAMING CONVENTIONS (STRICT)

All components MUST follow this pattern:

[LAYER] / [OBJECT] / [PURPOSE] / [VARIANT]

Examples:

Block / Transaction / Summary / Default

Element / Button / Primary / Disabled

Section / Timeline / Activity / Compact

❌ Prohibited:

Creative names

Role names in component names

Visual adjectives (“Fancy”, “Clean”)

SECTION 4 — VARIANTS & TOKENS
4.1 Allowed Variant Axes

State (default, hover, active, disabled)

Density (compact, standard)

Emphasis (primary, secondary, muted)

❌ Disallowed:

Role-based variants

Feature-based variants

One-off overrides

4.2 Token Discipline

Components may ONLY vary via:

Spacing tokens

Typography intent tokens

Color intent tokens

Never hardcode values.

SECTION 5 — COMPOSITION RULES

5.1 Downward Dependency Only

L5 may reference L4

L4 may reference L3

L3 may reference L2

L2 may reference L1

❌ No lateral or upward dependency.

5.2 No Visual Overrides in Screens
Screens may not override:

Padding

Typography

Color

Layout behavior

If override is required → component must be extended at its native layer.

SECTION 6 — ROLE & STATE HANDLING

6.1 Role Differences

Roles affect visibility, not structure

Never fork components by role

Role logic lives in data, not design

6.2 States
Every component must define:

Empty

Loading (if async)

Error (if actionable)

No “happy path only” components allowed.

SECTION 7 — EXTENSION PROCESS (CONTROLLED)
To introduce a new component:

Identify the correct layer

Attempt reuse first

Document why reuse fails

Propose new component with:

Purpose

Scope

Expected reuse

Obtain governance approval

SECTION 8 — DESIGN REVIEW CHECKLIST

Before handoff, designers must confirm:

☐ Component layer is correct

☐ Naming convention followed

☐ Variants are allowed

☐ No visual overrides

☐ Reuse evaluated

☐ States included

🚫 Failure = Rework Required

SECTION 9 — HANDOFF TO ENGINEERING

Each Figma component must include:

Component name

Layer

Purpose

Expected props / inputs

States

Reuse candidates

This allows 1:1 mapping to frontend components.

SECTION 10 — ENFORCEMENT

Components violating this contract are rejected

Legacy components must be refactored

No “temporary” exceptions without sunset date

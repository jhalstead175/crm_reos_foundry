UI Contract for Real Estate CRM SaaS
1. Layout Primitives
Panels:

Three-tier hierarchy: Primary (full-screen), Section (page subdivision), Contextual (toolbar/sidebar)

Panels must be programmatically identified as one of these tiers

Primary panels occupy 100% of viewport width; Section panels are responsive but maintain 32px margins; Contextual panels overlay content

Cards:

Represent discrete entities (contact, property, transaction, task)

Must contain exactly one primary action and 0-3 secondary actions

Cannot nest cards within cards

Always include a visual or textual method to identify card type

Lists:

Two types: Navigational (select leads to detail view) and Action (each item has independent actions)

Navigational lists must maintain selection state

Action lists must visually differentiate from navigational lists

Infinite scroll prohibited; pagination required beyond 50 items

Timelines:

Chronological display of events, communications, or status changes

Must support filtering by event type

Cannot combine user-generated content with system events without clear differentiation

Must display in reverse chronological order by default

2. Navigation Rules
Primary Navigation:

Persistent across all screens

Maximum 7 top-level items

Must support keyboard navigation with consistent tab order

Current location must be indicated with two independent visual cues (color + shape/position)

Contextual Navigation:

Appears only when relevant to current task

Must dismiss when primary context changes

Cannot contain essential functionality unavailable elsewhere

Maximum depth: 2 levels

Breadcrumbs:

Required for all screens more than one click from primary navigation

Must be clickable to previous levels

Must reflect actual user path, not just hierarchy

3. Information Density Guidelines
Three Density Levels:

Sparse (Dashboard/Overview): Maximum 3 information units per screen section

Standard (Working Views): 5-7 information units per screen section

Dense (Search/Comparison): 10+ information units with clear visual grouping

Density Controls:

Users must be able to change density between Standard and Dense

Sparse is reserved for specific screen types

Each density level must maintain minimum touch target of 32px

White space reduction must not reduce scannability below 85% as measured by eye-tracking proxy metrics

4. State Handling
Empty States:

Must explain why content is absent

Must provide at least one action to populate

Cannot use only icons; must include text explanation

Should educate rather than apologize

Loading States:

Must show progress indication for operations > 500ms

Skeleton screens required for full-page loads

Must differentiate between data loading and action processing

Cancellation must be available for operations > 5 seconds

Error States:

Must differentiate between system errors, validation errors, and user errors

Must provide recovery path, not just error message

Technical details must be available but hidden behind "Show details"

Must persist long enough for user to read (minimum 5 seconds or until dismissal)

Success States:

Must be subtle and non-disruptive

Must disappear automatically after 3 seconds

Must not require dismissal for workflow continuation

Should indicate what was successful, not just generic confirmation

5. Interaction Rules
Clicks/Taps:

Single interaction performs primary action

Must provide visual feedback within 100ms

Long press (≥1 second) reveals secondary actions if available

Right-click/context menu must mirror long-press functionality

Modals:

Only for actions requiring immediate attention before continuation

Must include escape path (X button + ESC key + click outside)

Cannot stack more than 2 modals

Must not exceed 50% viewport height on mobile

Drawers:

For supplementary actions that don't require full context switch

Must slide from edges only (left, right, bottom)

Must include handle or clear dismissal control

Content must be scrollable independently of main content

Form Interactions:

Inline validation only after field blur or form submission

Submit button must change state (loading → success/error)

Multi-step forms must show progress and allow backward navigation

6. Prohibited UI Patterns
Never Implement:

Infinite nested modals/drawers

Auto-playing media without user initiation

Scroll hijacking or custom scrollbars

Content that moves/disappears while user is interacting

"Mystery meat" navigation (unlabeled icons)

Confirmation dialogs for routine, reversible actions

Drag-and-drop as only method for reordering

Permanent hover states on touch devices

Custom right-click behavior that blocks browser defaults

Modals on page load (except legal requirements)

Conditional Prohibitions:

Tabs may contain only related content; no mixed contexts

Accordions may not nest more than 2 levels

Tooltips must not contain essential information

Notifications must not appear below content

7. Accessibility Baseline
Screen Readers:

All interactive elements must have programmatic labels

Live regions for dynamic content updates

Landmark roles (main, navigation, banner, complementary) on all screens

Page titles must update on navigation

Keyboard Navigation:

Logical tab order following visual layout

Visible focus indicator with minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

All functionality available via keyboard

Skip links at beginning of each page

Visual Accessibility:

Text contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1 (7:1 for critical information)

No information conveyed by color alone

Resizable text up to 200% without loss of functionality

Motion reduction preference respected

Cognitive Considerations:

Consistent navigation patterns across all screens

Action labels must use verbs, not just icons

Error messages must suggest solutions

Timeouts > 15 seconds must provide warning and extension option

Enforcement & Governance
This contract is enforced through:

Component Library Requirements - All UI components must document which contract rules they implement
CRM UI Contract & Design Governance

Code Review Checklist - Mandatory accessibility and interaction pattern review

Automated Testing - Contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attribute verification

Design System Tokens - All spacing, timing, and sizing values controlled through tokens

Quarterly Audit - Manual review of 10% of screens for contract compliance

Violations require:

Severity 1 (Accessibility/Data loss): Immediate fix, no deployment

Severity 2 (Usability): Fixed within sprint

Severity 3 (Consistency): Added to backlog for next major release

Contract Principle: "The interface should reveal complexity only as needed, guiding users through real estate workflows without exposing system complexity."

Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP
No Separate Modules For:
Dashboard/Home Screen (Transaction List is the home)

Calendar View (Timeline shows chronological, not calendar)

Reporting/Analytics (Transaction List shows status, that's it)

Marketing Tools (No email campaigns, social media, etc.)

Mobile App (Responsive web only)

Admin Panel (No user management beyond participant adding)

Integrations Hub (No third-party app connections)

Template Library (No saved message/document templates)

Workflow Builder (No automation rule creation)

Search Portal (No property search for buyers)

No Advanced Features:
Bulk operations (do things one at a time)

Custom views/filters (pre-defined filters only)

Export functionality (view in app only)

Offline mode (online required)

Keyboard shortcuts (mouse/touch only)

Dark mode (light mode only)

Multi-language (English only)

Accessibility beyond basic standards

MVP Screen Philosophy
Each screen serves exactly one purpose from the core journeys:

Lead → Transaction (Lead Capture Form → Transaction Detail)

Manage Transaction (Transaction Detail with all sub-views)

Coordinate with Others (Message Center, Participant Management)

Track Progress (Timeline, Task Board)

Handle Documents (Document Hub)

What makes this "minimum":

No dashboard means no decision about "what to show"

No calendar means no date management complexity

No reporting means no metric definition complexity

No settings means no configuration complexity

No integrations means no API complexity

The test: Can a new user sign up and manage a real transaction in under 15 minutes? If yes, MVP achieved.

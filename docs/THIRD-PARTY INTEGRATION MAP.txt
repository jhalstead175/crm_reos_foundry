THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION MAP

Governed Real Estate CRM

🟢 TIER 1 — REQUIRED FOR GA (FOUNDATIONAL)

These are infrastructure-grade dependencies. You cannot realistically ship GA without them.

1️⃣ Supabase (Core Backend)

Category: Backend, Auth, DB, Storage
Status: REQUIRED
You already approved this

Used for

Auth (identity only)

Postgres database

Row Level Security (safety net)

File storage (documents)

Optional realtime later

Governance Rules

Supabase = infrastructure only

No business logic

No RBAC in JWTs

/me view is authoritative

✅ Approved and locked

2️⃣ Email Service (Transactional)

Examples: Resend (recommended), Postmark, SendGrid
Category: System messaging
Status: REQUIRED

Used for

Invite emails

Login links (if magic link enabled)

System notifications (non-marketing)

Why Resend is a good fit

Simple API

Great deliverability

No marketing bloat

Developer-friendly

Governance Rules

🚫 No drip campaigns

🚫 No marketing automation

✔ Emails must correspond to explicit user actions

✔ Email sends logged as events

✅ Resend strongly recommended

3️⃣ PDF Generation

Examples: PDFKit, Puppeteer, DocRaptor
Category: Document generation
Status: REQUIRED (lightweight)

Used for

Transaction summaries

Deal timelines (export)

Audit-style summaries (later)

Governance Rules

PDFs are derived views, not records

No document editing inside PDFs

PDFs never become the source of truth

Recommendation

Start with server-side HTML → PDF

Avoid heavy SaaS PDF vendors early

🟡 TIER 2 — STRONGLY RECOMMENDED (POST-GA / EARLY SCALE)

These materially improve product value but should be added after GA stability.

4️⃣ Telephony / SMS

Examples: Twilio, Telnyx
Category: Communications
Status: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED

Used for

Call logging

SMS follow-ups

Optional voice agent (future)

Governance Rules

Calls/messages generate events

No hidden automations

No outbound spam

User explicitly initiates or enables

Twilio vs Telnyx

Twilio = easiest

Telnyx = cheaper, more control

🟡 Add after beta validation

5️⃣ Calendar Integration

Examples: Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook
Category: Scheduling
Status: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED

Used for

Logging meetings

Avoiding double entry

Syncing inspection dates

Governance Rules

Calendar events → timeline events

Sync is optional, not required

Never overwrite user calendars silently

6️⃣ Payment & Billing

Examples: Stripe
Category: Monetization
Status: REQUIRED FOR GA monetization

Used for

Subscriptions

Trials

Upgrades/downgrades

Governance Rules

Stripe handles money, not access logic

Capability checks remain internal

No pricing logic in frontend components

✅ Stripe is the clear choice

🟠 TIER 3 — DOMAIN-SPECIFIC (MLS, REAL ESTATE DATA)

These are strategic and should be introduced only when they support a clear workflow.

7️⃣ MLS / Listing Data

Examples:

MLS Grid

Bridge Interactive

Trestle

RESO Web API providers

Category: Real estate data
Status: DEFERRED (IMPORTANT)

Used for

Auto-creating properties

Reducing manual data entry

Listing context

Why this is tricky

Licensing varies by MLS

Legal agreements required

Data fragmentation

Governance Rules

MLS data is reference data only

Never authoritative over user-entered data

Imported data generates events (“Listing imported”)

🟠 Add after core workflow proves sticky

8️⃣ Mapping / Geocoding

Examples: Google Maps, Mapbox
Category: Visualization
Status: OPTIONAL

Used for

Examples: OpenAI, Anthropic
Category: Intelligence
Status: DEFERRED

Used for

Weekly summaries

Deal risk explanations

Advisor-grade insights

Governance Rules

AI outputs are explanations, not actions

AI never mutates data

AI suggestions are logged as events

10️⃣ Automation / Workflow Engine

Examples: Temporal, Trigger.dev
Category: Automation
Status: FUTURE

Used for

Guarded follow-ups

Delayed checks

SLA reminders

Governance Rules

Automation emits events

PRICING & PACKAGING STRATEGY

Capability-Based (Not Feature-Based)

1️⃣ PRICING PHILOSOPHY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
What You Are Selling

You are not selling features.
You are selling operational capability.

“What can this user do end-to-end?”

This matches:

Your event-first model

Your timeline mental model

Your post-GA roadmap

What You Explicitly Avoid

❌ Per-feature paywalls

❌ Nickel-and-diming seats

❌ Hidden limits

❌ Pricing that forces UX forks

2️⃣ PRICING UNIT (CRITICAL DECISION)
Primary Unit: Per Realtor / Agent

One paid seat = one primary operator

All secondary roles are free when invited

Why this works

Matches real value creation

Avoids charging buyers/sellers

Encourages collaboration (network effect)

Secondary Limits (Soft, Not Hard)

Used only to guide upgrades, not block usage:

Active transactions

Automation volume

Advanced insights

No sudden cut-offs.

4️⃣ WHAT IS ALWAYS FREE (IMPORTANT)

To fuel adoption and network effects:

Buyers

Sellers

Attorneys

Lenders

Insurance

Subcontractors

They:

Never pay

Never see pricing

Never hit paywalls

This is a strategic moat.

5️⃣ ADD-ONS (LATER, OPTIONAL)

Add-ons are capability extensions, not feature unlocks.

Examples:

AI Insights Pack (advisor-grade summaries)

Advanced Automations

Compliance / Audit Export (future)

Never required for core workflows.

6️⃣ UPGRADE TRIGGERS (NATURAL, NOT FORCED)

You don’t push upgrades with banners.
You let friction speak for itself.

Examples:

“You have 42 active transactions. Growth supports this cleanly.”

“This automation requires Growth or higher.”

Always:

Explain why

Show value

Offer trial upgrade

7️⃣ TRIAL STRATEGY (HIGH CONVERSION)
Recommended

14-day full-capability trial

Starts at Growth tier

Why:

Let users feel the difference vs FUB/Sisu

Downgrade friction-free if needed

8️⃣ ENTERPRISE / BROKERAGE PRICING (LATER)

Handled as:

Volume discounts

Centralized billing

SLA commitments

Do NOT create a separate UX.
Same product, same mental model.

9️⃣ INTERNAL SALES TALK TRACK (IMPORTANT)

“We don’t charge for features.
We charge for how much operational responsibility you want us to carry.”

This frames upgrades as relief, not cost.

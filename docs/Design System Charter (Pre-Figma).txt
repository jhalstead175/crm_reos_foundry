Design System Charter
System Name: Helios Realty Design System (HRDS)
Purpose: To unify the experience of managing complex real estate transactions across all platforms
Philosophy: "Professional clarity over decorative delight. Every interface element should accelerate deal velocity."

1. Design Tokens: The Atomic Foundation
Typography Tokens
Hierarchy & Intent:

text-headline: For primary page titles and critical workflow identification

text-subtitle: For section grouping and secondary context

text-body-{size}: For transactional content, contracts, and descriptions

text-label: For form fields, interactive elements, and metadata

text-caption: For legal disclaimers, timestamps, and auxiliary information

text-code: For property IDs, MLS numbers, and technical references

Governance Principle: Type conveys information hierarchy, not brand personality. Readability trumps expression.

Spacing Tokens
Scale & Relationship:

space-micro: For intimate relationships (icon to label, checkbox to text)

space-tight: For related elements within the same component

space-base: Standard separation between distinct but related items

space-loose: For separating distinct sections or card groups

space-section: Between major workflow sections

space-page: For framing content within viewport

Governance Principle: Spacing is relational arithmetic, not arbitrary. Use tokens to maintain proportional relationships across all screens.

Color Intent Tokens
Semantic, Not Decorative:

color-primary-action: One primary action per screen maximum

color-secondary-action: All other interactive elements

color-destructive-action: Irreversible or data-loss actions

color-success: Completed milestones, closed deals

color-warning: Attention required before proceeding

color-error: Blocking issues requiring immediate resolution

color-info: Supplemental information, status indicators

color-surface-{level}: For layering information hierarchy

color-text-{emphasis}: For readability against surfaces

color-data-{category}: For visualizing deal stages, financial ranges, or risk levels

Governance Principle: Color is functional first. Every color token must have a consistent behavioral expectation.

2. Component Hierarchy
2.1 Three-Tier Architecture
text
Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages
Atoms: Basic HTML elements with HRDS tokens applied (Button, Input, Badge)
Molecules: Functional combinations of atoms (Search bar, Property card, Date range picker)
Organisms: Complex assemblies with business logic (Offer workflow, Contact manager, Transaction timeline)
Templates: Page layouts with placeholder organisms
Pages: Fully realized templates with actual data and business context

2.2 Specialization by Domain
Certain organisms are real-estate specific and treated as first-class citizens:

TransactionPipeline: Visualizes deal stages across roles

DocumentSigningFlow: Manages multi-party signature workflows

CommissionCalculator: Domain-specific tool with industry rules

PropertyComparisonTable: Specialized data visualization

3. Naming Conventions
3.1 Component Naming: {Domain}-{Function}-{Variant}
Domain Prefix: transaction-, property-, contact-, document-, communication-

Function: What it does (card, form, list, viewer, editor)

Variant: Visual or behavioral variation (compact, expanded, readonly)

Examples:

transaction-timeline-compact

property-card-expanded

document-signer-readonly

3.2 Token Naming: {category}-{property}-{variant}
Category: color, spacing, typography, radius, shadow

Property: What it affects (background, text, border, padding)

Variant: Scale or intent (primary, small, tight, danger)

Examples:

color-background-success

spacing-padding-tight

typography-headline-large

3.3 File Structure
text
/components
  /atoms
    /button
      button.primary.js
      button.secondary.js
      button.test.js
      button.stories.js
  /molecules
    /property-card
      index.js (exports all variants)
      property-card.base.js
      property-card.compact.js
4. Responsive Behavior Principles
4.1 Content-First Breakpoints
We define breakpoints by content necessity, not device sizes:

breakpoint-tight: When horizontal space compromises readability

breakpoint-stacked: When components must switch to vertical layout

breakpoint-dense: When information density can increase safely

breakpoint-expanded: When additional contextual information can be revealed

4.2 Progressive Disclosure
Mobile First: Design for core task completion on smallest viewport

Add Context: As space increases, reveal supporting information

Maintain Priority: Primary action never moves or becomes hidden

Preserve Relationships: Connected elements maintain visual proximity

4.3 Adaptive, Not Just Responsive
Data Tables: Switch from horizontal scroll to card stack at breakpoint-stacked

Transaction Views: Timeline shifts from horizontal to vertical at breakpoint-tight

Comparison Tools: Side-by-side becomes sequential comparison

Navigation: Primary actions remain accessible via bottom bar on mobile

Governance Principle: The user's task should dictate layout changes, not arbitrary screen widths.

5. Motion & Feedback Philosophy
5.1 Motion with Purpose
Three Categories of Motion:

Functional: Helps user understand state changes (drawer slides, modal appearances)

Progressive: Guides through multi-step workflows (form steps, wizard transitions)

Feedback: Confirms user actions (button presses, successful saves)

Motion Rules:

Duration never exceeds 300ms for functional motion

Easing curves match physical metaphor (enter: ease-out, exit: ease-in)

No motion without user intent or system necessity

Respect reduced-motion preferences at OS level

5.2 Feedback Hierarchy
Immediate (<100ms): Visual state change on interaction (button press)
Fast (<500ms): Inline validation, auto-save confirmation
Deliberate (1-3s): Complex operation progress, multi-step processes
Persistent: Requires user acknowledgment (errors, warnings)

Feedback Principle: The weight of feedback should match the consequence of the action.

6. When to Extend vs Reuse Components
6.1 The Extension Decision Tree
text
Is the desired behavior >80% similar to existing component?
    ├── Yes → Extend with variant
    │       ├── Does it require new business logic?
    │       │   ├── Yes → Create domain-specific variant
    │       │   └── No → Create visual variant only
    │       └── Document usage patterns
    │
    └── No → Consider new component
            ├── Will this be used in ≥3 distinct contexts?
            │   ├── Yes → Create new base component
            │   └── No → Create one-off implementation (rare)
            └── New component must follow naming conventions
6.2 Extension Criteria
Extend when:

Visual style differs but behavior identical (e.g., button color variant)

Minor functionality addition (e.g., input with icon)

Domain-specific data visualization using existing patterns

Responsive behavior variations of same component

Create new when:

Interaction pattern differs fundamentally (click vs drag)

Data model requires different API structure

Accessibility considerations demand different markup

Performance characteristics differ significantly

6.3 The Variant Scale
text
Level 1: CSS-only variant (different appearance)
Level 2: Minor prop addition (icon, helper text)
Level 3: Behavioral variant (controlled vs uncontrolled)
Level 4: Domain-specific variant (adds business logic)
Level 5: New component (distinct interaction model)
Governance Rule: Progress beyond Level 3 requires Design System Team review.

Charter Amendments & Evolution
This charter may be amended quarterly based on:

Usage Analytics: Component adoption and variant utilization

Accessibility Audits: WCAG compliance testing results

Performance Metrics: Bundle size impact of new patterns

User Feedback: Pain points in real estate workflow tasks

Amendment Process: Proposal → 30-day review period → 2/3 Design System Team approval → Update charter version.

Final Principle: "A design system for real estate must be as reliable as a title search, as clear as a property disclosure, and as efficient as a well-run closing."
